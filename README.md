Script to automatically generate picking lists for Echo 650 Acoustic Liquid Dispenser


## Purpose
We have an automated Echo 650 protocol, combined with a robotic arm, that dispenses liquid from Control and Compound plates into an assay plate. In order to function, the process needs a picking lists with exact instructions of how to dispense each liquid from/to where and how much.

This script is designed to make the generation of picking lists as flexible and as easy as possible.

## What is needed:
·Python3.10. 
·Pip package installer: The code already contains the instruction to check if necessary libraries exist and if not, it installs them via pip
